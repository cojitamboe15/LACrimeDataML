    "`Client Story:` A Los Angeles-based realtor wants to know which areas of Los Angeles to invest in (buy real estate). Since safety is a major concern for potential customers, the real estate agency wants to know the safest municipalities in the city to do business in. Thus, the real estate agency prefers to avoid areas of Los Angeles that may be risky to do business in. Areas with higher crime may scare away customers which could lead to a net loss of the investment. Market real estate price is not an issue to be wary of, the real estate agency solely wants to focus on the crime levels of the municipalities within the city. Important to note that the project goal is not solely to define the municipalities in the present but predict the potential crime levels for the future. This ensures that the real estate investment is worthwhile in the long run and has net gains over an extended period of time. \n"

Asking multiple questions about different crimes and their reoccurence and rate their municipality from a range of 1 to 10. 1 meaning very safe, 10 very dangerous. The ending score for each surveyer would be the average of their ratings. All the surveys would then be combined and averaged out. \n",
